There are package manifest upgrade issues from 2019.1 to 2019.2 when testing framework is used.

"com.unity.test-framework.performance": "0.1.50-preview" 
in 2019.1 

becomes

"com.unity.test-framework": "1.0.13",
"com.unity.test-framework.performance": "1.2.5-preview"
in 2019.2

But the automatic upgrade seems to not be doing a good job.


When upgrading from 2019.2 manifest to 2019.3 manifest seems to happen without issues.


Due reasons above, we'll use 2019.2 manifest as base which can be upgraded to higher version.
